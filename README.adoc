This project is a customized version of the Antora Default UI, tailored for the Evergreen ILS documentation site. It provides branding, navigation updates, and enhanced features specific to Evergreen's needs.

[NOTE]
====
Evergreen is an open-source integrated library system (ILS) used by libraries worldwide. This UI adheres to Evergreen's branding guidelines to maintain a professional and cohesive representation.
====

== Use the Evergreen UI

To use this customized UI for your Antora-generated site, add the following UI configuration to your Antora playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/IanSkelskey/eg-antora/releases/latest/download/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true

runtime:
  fetch: true
----

NOTE: The `snapshot` flag ensures that Antora fetches the UI bundle when the `--fetch` command-line flag is used. The `runtime.fetch` option ensures the latest bundle is retrieved.
